# d3-v4-playground
 
[LIVE EXAMPLE](http://bgrsquared.com/d3v4/)
 
We are using d3-v4 (most notably: [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape)) in react.

Currently, there are 3 examples

* A very simple svg container with a static line and a static pie chart (d3-shape)

* An example using d3.v3 layouts (so mixing v3 & v4), 
[shamelessly borrowed here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607999).

* A slightly more advanced dynamic example using
 [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) for animations and
 [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) for data management.

We are currently preparing a short Medium article to describe the ideas a bit more in detail.

Feedback, ideas, ... is much appreciated!
